\section{INTRODUCTION}
%%%% %%%% %%%% %%%%

{\Product} is an interactive theorem prover in the HOL family.
Since it is the ITP with which I am most familiar, it is a good place for me to start exploring the application of "deep learning" to interactive theorem proving.

A good variety of software is available in the Python language for use in Deep Learning, including particularly the Google TensorFlow software.
A higher level interface which works with Tensorflow and Theano is prtovided by the Keras package.
This document provides SML structures which facilitate access to these python packages.
Since cross language facilities in Standard ML are generally implementation dependent, this module is expected to work only with PolyML.


The remainder of this document is structured as follows:
\begin{description}
\item[Section~\ref{sec:discussion}] the various python packages to which acces is provided
\item[Section~\ref{sec:structure}] documents the interfaces provided in
the style of the {\Product} reference manual.
\end{description}
