\section{INTRODUCTION}

My first ideas on providing support for defining structures by transfinite induction was to introduce an axiom of infinity in the constext of a new type of 'a ordinals and to use that to provide a type of infinitary trees.
I did not get very far in that approach.

Later I returned and sought a fuller understanding of how to use such a strong axiom of infinity to introduce new large types, addressing the construction of V from Ord.
This lead to a more general understanding of how one can use Ord directly in the construction of structures defined by transfinite induction.

On the basis of that understanding it became apparent to me that the introduction of polymorphic transfinite inductive types required a polymorphic type of 'a ordinals, in which the cardinality of the 'a ordinals depends on the cardinality of the type parameter (which might be thought of as representing a well-ordered collection of urelements). 

The present work in progress on this document is the adding of this polymorphism, in anticipation of provision of some generic facility for introducing structures by transfinite induction.

The idea of developing a type of infinitary trees is now discarded in favour of working directly from the 'a ordinals.


\section{TRANSFINITE DATATYPES FROM ORDINALS}

My original idea for the work in this document arose from questioning whether an axiomatisation of a set theory was the best way to strengthen HOL, and from wondering whether, for example, a type of infinitary trees might serve the kinds of purpose for which I have until now uses axiomatic set theory in a neater way.

More recently, reflections on how to extract the power from a strong axiom of infinity (of which the axiom for the \emph{'a ordinals} above is an example), I have wondered whether the kinds of desired construction could not be done directly from the \emph{'a ordinals} without an intermediate construction of a type of infinitary trees.

A first exploration of ways of exploiting such an axiom of infinity may be undertaken through the exercise of constructing from the 'a ordinals the largest possible initial segment of the cumulative heirarchy.
I spent a little time thinking about this case, eventually arriving at some ideas for a solution to the more general problem of obtaining representation for mutually recursive infinitary datatypes.

Thinking about this has lead me to an augmentation to the basis on which the axiom of infinity is expressed.
I originally took a new type and chose an arbitrary well-ordering of the type.
I now think it would be better to chose a minimal well-ordering, i.e. one which is an initial 'a ordinal.
This will give better closure properties in the resulting initial segment of the cumulative heirarchy.
However, I don't need to make that change before attempting the construction, which is what I aim to do here.
To support polymorphic structures I have concluded that the axiom of infinity should be stated for a polymorphic rather than a monomorphic type.
The resulting infinity is then required to exceed the cardinality of the type parameter.
This is necessary to make instantiation of a polymorphic datatype to a large type (such as ”ONE ordinal®) work

The method is to give a definition by transfinite induction/recursion of am enumeration of the values to be obtained by projection from the new abstract types.  This enumeration is then the projection function for the new type (a combined projector for all the constructors of whatever type delivering for a single type definition the disjoint union of the domain types of the constructors, for multiple types a disjoint union of disjoint unions).
Of course, if there are multiple types there could not be a combined function from those types, it would not be well typed.
The function goes not from the abstract types themselves, but from their common representation type, the ordinals, which are partitioned to give distinct representations for the different types being introduced.
This single projection function can then be used to define separate projection functions for each of the abstract types introduced.

\subsection{Definitions for the General Construction}

A single operator is to be defined which takes a parameter characterising the required new types.
This characterisation is provided by a function which, given an infinitary sequence of values, returns the set of values which can be constructed from those values.
The domain of this function will be a partial version of the desired uniform projector (a total function over the type of indexes, together with an index indicating the domain over which that function is to be considered defined, the index is the strict supremum of the indexes over which the function is considered defined), so that the projection (so far) can be used to test the types of the available components, and the indexes can be used in constructing new values.
The enumeration of all the values is constructed in order of rank (i.e. the number of constructions necessary to obtain the desired value from nothing).
Within each rank an initial least well-ordering is obtained by use of the choice function.
New values are selected for coding by taking the next element from that well-ordering.
When the well-ordering is exhausted a new rank will be coded, if there are any new values which can be obtained by applying the functor again to the new collection of codings.

To make the recursion work in HOL we define an auxiliary function which delivers extra information so that we can remember the set of uncoded elements at the current rank until it has been exhausted.

The information supplied by the auxiliary function for each 'a ordinal is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item the value assigned to this 'a ordinal
\item the rank of the value coded by this 'a ordinal
\item the set of new values at this rank yet to be coded
\item a well-ordering of the values at this rank
\item if this is a valid code then T else F (this will be false if all possible values have already been assigned a code)
\end{enumerate}

The final coding is projected from this function.

The question which faces us here is, given an initial segment of a map from indexes to structures of the above kind, how we deliver the next element of the map.
Stating it informally, first we check whether the coding has been completed, by testing for a code (ordinal) below the present value which has not been assigned a value.
If there is such a code the present code will have no value either.
Otherwise we establish whether the new value will be of the same rank as its latest predecessors, or whether it will be the first of the next rank.

To determine this we first check whether there is a highest rank among the predecessors.
If not, then the next value coded must have a limit 'a ordinal as its rank, and must be the first value of that rank.

If there is a highest rank among the predecessors we then form the set of values at that rank which have not yet been coded, by taking the intersection of the set of uncoded values associated with each coded value at this rank.
If this set is empty then the current 'a ordinal must be the first to code a set of the next higher rank, otherwise the 'a ordinal will code a set of the same rank as its latest predecessors and its position in that rank will be the strict supremum of all the positions occupied by its predecessors at that rank.
The value it codes is obtained using the choice function on the set of as yet uncoded values at that rank.

If we are starting a new rank then the new rank is the strict supremum of the previous ranks.
The first 'a ordinal coding a value of that rank is the present 'a ordinal.
We obtain the set of values at this rank by taking the set of all those values constructable from previous 'a ordinals which are not already coded by one of them.
We then chose an element of that collection, which will be the value coded by the present 'a ordinal, and remove that element from the set of as-yet uncoded values.

On the basis of this sketch I propose to define separately the test for an 'a ordinal coding the first set of a rank, the values of the 4-tuple in that case and the value of the 4 tuple otherwise before combining these in an inductive definition.

The ranks which have been partly or wholly coded can be extracted from a partial enumeration as follows:

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛRanksÝ: (('a ­ ('a, 'b)5TUP) ¸ 'a) ­ 'a ð
÷üüüüüüüüüüü
Ü µf x· Ranks (f, x) = {y | ¶z· z <‰i‰w‰o z ± TRank (f z) = y}
°

The first rank which has not yet been partially or wholly coded is the
strict supremum of those ranks

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛSSRankÝ: (('a ­ ('a, 'b)5TUP) ¸ 'a) ­ 'a
÷üüüüüüüüüüü
Ü µf x· SSRank (f, x) = SSup‰i‰w‰o (Ranks (f, x))
°

If SSRank is a limit ordinal then the next coded element will be of that new
rank.
Otherwise we need to know whether the predecessor rank is exhausted.
In that case the predecessor is the supremum.

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛSRankÝ: (('a ­ ('a, 'b)5TUP) ¸ 'a) ­ 'a
÷üüüüüüüüüüü
Ü µf x· SRank (f, x) = Sup‰i‰w‰o (Ranks (f, x))
°

To chose another element of some incomplete rank for coding we need to get the set of not-yet coded elements.
This is the set of elements each of which is in the residual set for every coded element of that rank (or the intersection of those residues).

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛRankRes1Ý: (('a ­ ('a, 'b)5TUP) ¸ 'a)  ¸ 'a
Ü	­ 'b ð
÷üüüüüüüüüüü
Ü µf x y· RankRes1 ((f, x), y) =
Ü   	¥ {r | ¶ro· ro <‰i‰w‰o x ± TRank(f ro) = y ± r = TRes(f ro)}
°

This function delivers the residual set, which may be empty, without being
told the rank.

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛRankRes2Ý: (('a ­ ('a, 'b)5TUP) ¸ 'a) ­ 'b ð
÷üüüüüüüüüüü
Ü µf x· RankRes2 (f, x) =
Ü   	if Limit‰i‰w‰o (SSRank (f, x))
Ü	then {}
Ü	else RankRes1 ((f, x), SRank (f, x))
°

If there are no values to be coded then we need to step up to the next rank.
To do this we collect together all the values so far coded, apply the constructor function to determine what can be constructed from them, and remove from the reaults anything which has already been coded.

The following function obtains the set of values already coded.

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛValuesCodedÝ: (('a ­ ('a, 'b)5TUP) ¸ 'a)
Ü		­ 'b SET
÷üüüüüüüüüüü
Ü µf x· ValuesCoded (f, x) = {y | ¶z· z <‰i‰w‰o x ± TValid(f z) ± TValue(f z)=y}
°

This functor upgrades the constructor function to one which only returns new values.

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛNewValFuncÝ: ((('a ­ ('a, 'b)5TUP) ¸ 'a) ­ 'b ð)
Ü		­ ((('a ­ ('a, 'b)5TUP) ¸ 'a) ­ 'b ð)
÷üüüüüüüüüüü
Ü µm· NewValFunc m = Ìs· (m s) \ (ValuesCoded s)
°

The following function takes an initial segment (the predecessors of some 'a) of the map from articles to 5TUPs and computes the next 5TUP.

The prior enumeration of 5TUPs, the new rank, and the function for computing the elements of this rank are supplied as arguments.

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛNext5TÝ: ('a ­ ('a, 'b)5TUP)
Ü		­ 'a

Ü  Next5T f x m =
Ü	if ¶z:'a· z <‰i‰w‰o x ± ³ TValid(f z)
Ü	then Mk5TUP (Åx:'b·T) (Åx:'a·T) (Åx:'b ð·T)

Ü	else	let res = RankRes2 (f, x)

				and nvs = (NewValFunc m) (f, x)

	if nvs = {}
	then Mk5TUP (Åx:'b·T) (Åx:'a·T) (Åx:'b ð·T)

\subsection{Some Theorems}

The development of the theory here is somewhat ad. hoc., driven by the needs of the examples which follow.

A general pattern should emerge which is similar to the kinds of results noramlly obtained when recursive datatype are introduced, with certain modifications arising from the infinitary nature of the facility.

However, in this development the exceptions are the norm, and the results normally expected may not be derived early, (or at all).
Much of the complication in the non-infinitary cases arises from the presence of multiple types and of multiple constructors for each type.
In the simplest infinitary example, which is where we start here (set theory), there is only one constructor, set formation, and only one type, the type of pure sets.

In that case the key results required are firstly that the projection is a bijection, and a principal of induction on the rank of the construction (or on an ordering correponding to the order of the codes).

\subsubsection{Lemmas about Next5T}

\subsubsection{That Projections are Bijections}

An elementary requirement is that the projection function is a bijection over its domain of well-definedness (which will in the examples usually be the whole type, though if the constructions are used for more ordinary datatypes this may not be the case).

Some auxiary definitions may be helpful in obtaining this result.
We need the concept of partial injection.

¹HOLCONST

\section{WORKED EXAMPLES}
\subsection{Set Theory from Ordinals}

This section uses the simplest of transfinite inductive definitions to check the definitions and force the development of the general theory above.

We define a membership relation over the 'as which should make it into an initial segment of the cumulative hierarchy.
In this example its not strictly necessary to introduce a new type of sets, since the membership relation will be defined over the entire type of ;as.

The polymorphism can be handled in two ways.
In the more complex treatment, a set ofs having the same cardinality as the type parameter are taken as urelemente, and the construction carries on from there.

In the simpler case we simply ignore the type parameter, begin by enumerating the power set of the empty set and take it from there.
The effect of type parameterisation is solely in its influence on how far you can go, as a result of its effect on the cardinality of thes.

Since the motivation for the type parameter was the second of these, and this is also the easiest to do, thats what I will use as the first test case.

\subsubsection{Defining the Membership Relation}


I now define the required map function, which takes an encoding of a collection of sets, and returns the set of sets which can be constructed from that collection (its power set).

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛSetsMapÝ: (('a ­ ('a, 'a SET)5TUP) ¸ 'a) 
Ü		­ 'a SET SET
÷üüüüüüüüüüü
Ü µf x·  SetsMap (f, x) = ð (X‰i‰w‰o x)
°

Using the resulting projection function we can define membership over thes as follows:

=SML
declare_infix(230,"‰x");
=TEX

¹HOLCONST
Ü $Û‰xÝ: 'a ­ 'a ­ BOOL
÷üüüüüüüüüüü
Ü µx y·  x ‰x y ¤ x  (Map2Projection SetsMap) y
°

\subsubsection{Extensionality}

The first thing to prove is extensionality.
Extensionality is the consequence in this simple example of the general feature of this kind of construction, that the projection function is a bijection (hence no two values code the same set values.
So before presenting the extensionality theorem I step back to prove that the codings are all bijections (over their defined part).
